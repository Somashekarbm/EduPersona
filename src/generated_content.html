<div class="question-container">
  <div class="question">
    <h2>Question 1: What are the three characteristics of Software?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Software is engineered not manufactured, software doesn't wear out and software is custom built</p>
  </div>
  <div class="simplified-content">
    <h2>Software & Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>Software engineers use computer science, engineering, and math principles to design, develop, and test software. They analyze user needs, then design, build, test, and maintain software systems.</p>
    <h3>Why is Software Engineering Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates high-quality software</li>
      <li>Makes software development more efficient</li>
      <li>Helps software engineers feel more satisfied with their work</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question-container">
  <div class="question">
    <h2>Question 2: What is the definition of a Process in software engineering?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>A process is a collection of activities, actions and tasks that are performed when some work product is to be created</p>
  </div>
  <div class="simplified-content">
    <p>Software engineering is about designing, building, and maintaining software using engineering principles. It involves understanding user needs, planning a solution, building it, and testing it thoroughly. Software development is a complex process, and using a well-defined model or framework helps manage this complexity. There are various models like the Waterfall model, which is sequential, and agile models, which are iterative. These models provide a roadmap for the team, ensuring that software is built in a structured and organized manner, leading to a higher-quality product. Understanding these principles and models is essential for anyone involved in software development. It ensures that the final product is not only functional but also maintainable and scalable in the long run.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <h2>Question 3: What are the primary goals of Software Engineering?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <ul>
      <li>To improve the quality of software products</li>
      <li>To increase the productivity</li>
      <li>To give job satisfaction to the software engineers</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="simplified-content">
    <p>Software Engineering focuses on designing, writing, testing, and maintaining software to create reliable and efficient products. It involves understanding user needs, planning, creating models, building the software, and deploying it. Different process models like Waterfall, Incremental, Evolutionary (Prototyping, Spiral), and specialized models (Component-Based, Formal Methods, Aspect-Oriented) guide the development process. Key principles include focusing on user value, simplicity, maintaining a clear vision, considering future maintenance, planning for reuse, and thoughtful planning before coding. Software engineering aims to debunk myths about software development and promote realistic expectations.</p>

<div class="question-container">
  <div class="question">
    <h2>Question 4: What are the concerns about applying the Formal Methods Model in a business environment?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <ul>
      <li>The development of formal models is currently time consuming and expensive</li>
      <li>Few developers have the required formal methods background</li>
      <li>The models are difficult to use as a communication mechanism for non-technical customers</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="simplified-content">
    <h2>Formal Methods Model: Concerns</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>**Expensive:** Requires specialized skills and takes longer, increasing costs.</li>
      <li>**Steep Learning Curve:** Most developers need significant training.</li>
      <li>**Communication Gap:** Difficult to explain to non-technical stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
